 <h1> Intro </h1> 
 <p style="font-size:2vw;"> There are billions of pounds of trash and other pollutants in the ocean every single year. Most of the pollution that ends up in 
  the ocean is due to human activities. There are two types of ocean pollution: Nonpoint source pollution and point source pollution. Nonpoint
 source pollution results from vehicles, farms, and sceptic tanks. This is different from point source pollution where the pollution is a result from
 a specific event such as a chemical spill. Also, land run-off is one most detrimental process for the ocean. Land run-off is where pollutants enter the ocean
 due to rain or flooding that runs off land into the ocean. 36% of the oil that enters the ocean occurs from land run-off showing how important it is to figure out a 
 way to prevent this.</p>

  <h1 style="font-size:2vw;"> Garbage Patches </h1> 
 <p style="font-size:2vw;"> Due the abunant amount of trash in the oceans, garbage piles up into garbage patches. These garbage patches are formed due to the 
 ocean currents called gyres. A common misconception is that these garbage patches are on an island in the Ocean. However, the trash is in the water and extends from the surface
 to the ocean floor. </p>

  <h1 style="font-size:2vw;"> Effects on Sea Life  </h1> 
 <p style="font-size:2vw;">  Animals and plants in the sea are heavily affected by our actions on land. Just in the North Pacific ocean, fish consume around 15,000 pounds of plastic per year. 
 This leads to severe intestinal injury, along with death. Along with fish, sea birds also consume a lot of plastic and other pollutants as they mistake plastic for food. 
When these birds eat plastic, it reduces the storage volume in the stomach, ultimately leading to starvation. Furthemore, sea turtles and other sea mammals can get tied up in 
 plastic and other litter which can result in death. We have to do something so that the animals will stop stuffering at the hands of human pollution. </p>

  <br> 
 
 <h1 style="font-size:2vw;"> Effects on Humans  </h1> 
 <p style="font-size:2vw;"> Many people think that Ocean Pollution only affects marine animals, however Ocean Pollution affects humans as well. One interesting statistic is that 70 percent of the oxygen
 that humans breate comes from marine plants. If these marine plants continue to get affected by Ocean Pollution, then the amount of oxygen we have will deminish.
 This can have an affect on our well being as the fish that humans eat will consume litter, toxic pollutants, and other pollutants of the ocean. This shows how ocean 
 pollution does not only affect the fish and sea life, but it affects us as well. Heart disease, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease can result from when humans consume 
 heavy metal's such as mercury. This is why we have to be careful and make sure we don't continue to pollute our ocean. </p>
