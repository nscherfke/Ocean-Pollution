 <h1> Intro </h1> 
 <br>
<br>
 <p> There are billions of pounds of trash and other pollutants in the ocean every single year. Most of the pollution that ends up in 
  the ocean is due to human activities. There are two types of ocean pollution: Nonpoint source pollution and point source pollution. Nonpoint
 source pollution results from vehicles, farms, and sceptic tanks. This is different from point source pollution where the pollution is a result from
 a specific event such as a chemical spill. </p>

  <h1> Garbage Patches </h1> 
 <p> Due the abunant amount of trash in the oceans, garbage piles up into garbage patches. These garbage patches are formed due to the 
 ocean currents called gyres. A common misconception is that these garbage patches are on an island in the Ocean. However, the trash is in the water and extends from the surface
 to the ocean floor. </p>
